Im reacreating a live feed nasa control center  and data logger. Frontend: Under the following containers (stations) following the real MOCC UT TIme , Boost, Flight , Capcom , GNC , EECOM/TELMU , CONTROL but adapted for ksp using boostra386 for the retro look
Backend: WIll use KPRC to collect data at set interals and expose it to the web front end , it wil also write data for all stations for each flight into a sqllite db to by analyzed 

Last convo :


Certainly! In this conversation, we discussed building a Mission Control Center for the game Kerbal Space Program (KSP). The project includes both a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is built with HTML and Bootstrap, and it is designed to display live mission data. The back-end uses Flask and KRPC to fetch game data, which is then stored in an SQLite database. The frontend has various "stations," modeled after a real-life Mission Control Center, that show different types of mission information such as Boost, Flight, Capcom, GNC, EECOM/TELMU, and Control.

We modified the HTML code to include additional fields like 'Pitch' and 'Roll' in the Flight Engineer Station (FES) section, and discussed adding a 'Critical Alerts' section in the Control Station for important warnings.

Finally, we sketched out a directory structure to organize the project:
```
KSP_Mission_Control/
|-- backend/
|   |-- app.py                  # Main Flask app
|   |-- db.py                   # Database handling (SQLite setup, queries)
|   |-- krpc_interface.py       # Interface to interact with KRPC
|   |-- [Other station-specific Python files]
|
|-- frontend/
|   |-- index.html              # Your current HTML file
|   |-- script.js               # JavaScript for front-end logic
|   |-- styles.css              # Extra styles if needed
|
|-- db/
|   |-- flights.db              # SQLite database file
|
|-- README.md                   # Project documentation
|-- requirements.txt            # Required Python packages
```

You mentioned that you forgot to enable plugins, which I assume means that you wanted to save this information in a more organized way. Regardless, you can copy this summary for future reference.
